# RECONNAISSANCE
- Utilize port scanning
- Map visible content
- Discover hidden & default content
- Utilize shodan for finding similar apps and endpoints
- Utilize the waybackmachine for finding forgotten endpoints
- Test for debug parameters & Dev parameters
- Identify data entry points
- Identify the technologies used
- Map the attack surface and application
 
# ACCESS CONTROL TESTING
- Authentication
- Test password quality rules
- Test for username enumeration
- Test resilience to password guessing
- Test password creation strength
- Test any account recovery function
- Test any "remember me" function
- Test any impersonation function
- Test username uniqueness
- Check for unsafe distribution of credentials
- Test for fail-open conditions
- Test any multi-stage mechanisms
- Session Management
- Test tokens for meaning
- Test tokens for predictability
- Check for insecure transmission of tokens
- Check for disclosure of tokens in logs
- Check mapping of tokens to sessions
- Check session termination
- Check for session fixation
- Check for cross-site request forgery
- Check cookie scope
- Access Controls
- Understand the access control requirements
- Test effectiveness of controls, using multiple accounts if possible
- Test for insecure access control methods (request parameters, Referrer header, etc)
 
#  INPUT VALIDATION AND HANDLING
- Fuzz all request parameters
- Test for SQL injection
- Identify all reflected data
- Test for reflected XSS
- Test for HTTP header injection
- Test for arbitrary redirection
- Test for stored attacks
- Test for OS command injection
- Test for path traversal
- Test for JavaScript/HTML injection
- Test for file inclusion - both local and remote
- Test for SMTP injection
- Test for SOAP injection
- Test for LDAP injection
- Test for XPath injection
- Test for template injection
- Test for XXE injection
 
# APPLICATION/BUSINESS LOGIC
- Identify the logic attack surface
- Test transmission of data via the client
- Test for reliance on client-side input validation
- Test any thick-client components (Java, ActiveX, Flash)
- Test multi-stage processes for logic flaws
- Test handling of incomplete input
- Test trust boundaries
- Test transaction logic
- Test for Indirect object references(IDOR)

# APPLICATION INFRASTRUCTURE
- Test segregation in shared infrastructures/ virtual hosting environments
- Test segregation between ASP-hosted applications
- Test for web server vulnerabilities - this can be tied into port scanning and infrastructure assessments
- Default credentials
- Default content
- Dangerous HTTP methods
- Proxy functionality

# MISCELLANEOUS TESTS
- Check for DOM-based attacks - open redirection, cross site scripting, client side validation.
- Check for frame injection, frame busting(can still be an issue)
- Check for local privacy vulnerabilities
- Persistent cookies
- Weak cookie options
- Caching
- Sensitive data in URL parameters
- Follow up any information leakage
- Check for weak SSL ciphers
- HTTP Header analysis - look for lack of security headers such as:
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- X-XSS-Protection
- X-Content-Type-Options
- HTTP Public Key Pinning
