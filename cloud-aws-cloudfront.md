INFO

Cloudfront is a CDN and it checks the HOST header in CNAMES, so:
- The domain "test.disloops.com" is a CNAME record that points to "disloops.com".
- The "disloops.com" domain is set up to use a CloudFront distribution.
- Because "test.disloops.com" was not added to the "Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)" field for the distribution, requests to "test.disloops.com" will fail.
- Another user can create a CloudFront distribution and add "test.disloops.com" to the "Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)" field to hijack the domain.
