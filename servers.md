File Server - File servers provide a great way to share files across devices on a network.

Mail Server - Mail servers move and store mail over corporate networks (via LANs and WANs) and across the Internet.

Database Server - A database server is a computer system that provides other computers with services related to accessing and retrieving data from one or multiple databases.
