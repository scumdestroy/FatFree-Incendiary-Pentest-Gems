# Example #1: Search the network for filenames that may contain creds
# NOTE: matching files are automatically downloaded into $HOME/.manspider/loot! (-n to disable)
$ manspider 192.168.0.0/24 -f passw user admin account network login logon cred -d evilcorp -u bob -p Passw0rd

# Example #2: Search for XLSX files containing "password"
$ manspider share.evilcorp.local -c password -e xlsx -d evilcorp -u bob -p Passw0rd

# Example #3: Search for interesting file extensions
$ manspider share.evilcorp.local -e bat com vbs ps1 psd1 psm1 pem key rsa pub reg txt cfg conf config -d evilcorp -u bob -p Passw0rd

# Example #4: Search for finance-related files
# This example searches financy-sounding directories for filenames containing 5 or more consecutive numbers (e.g. 000202006.EFT)
$ manspider share.evilcorp.local --dirnames bank financ payable payment reconcil remit voucher vendor eft swift -f '[0-9]{5,}' -d evilcorp -u bob -p Passw0rd

# Example #5: Search for certificates
$ manspider share.evilcorp.local -e pfx p12 pkcs12 pem key crt cer csr jks keystore key keys der -d evilcorp -u bob -p Passw0rd

# Usage Tip #1:
> You can run multiple instances of manspider at one time. This is useful when one instance is already running, and you want to search what it's downloaded (similar to grep -R). To do this, specify the keyword loot as the target, which will search the downloaded files in $HOME/.manspider/loot.

# Usage Tip #2:
> Reasonable defaults help prevent unwanted scenarios like getting stuck on a single target. All of these can be overridden:
```
default spider depth: 10 (override with -m)
default max filesize: 10MB (override with -s)
default threads: 5 (override with -t)
shares excluded: C$, IPC$, ADMIN$, PRINT$ (override with --exclude-sharenames)
```
# Usage Tip #3:
> Manspider accepts any combination of the following as targets:
```
IPs
hostnames
subnets (CIDR format)
files containing any of the above
local folders containing files
```
For example, you could specify any or all of these:
```
192.168.1.250
share.evilcorp.local
192.168.1.0/24
smb_hosts.txt
loot (to search already-downloaded files)
/mnt/share (to recursively search a directory)
NOTE: when searching local files, you must specify a directory, not an individual file
```
