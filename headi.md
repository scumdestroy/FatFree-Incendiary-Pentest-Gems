# Install
`go get github.com/mlcsec/headi`

# Usage
Two options for HTTP header injection:

Default payloads (127.0.0.1, localhost, etc.) are injected into the headers mentioned above
Custom payloads can be supplied (e.g. you've enumerated some internal IPs or domains) using the pfile parameter

# Usage:
```
  headi -u https://target.com/resource
  headi -u https://target.com/resource -p internal_addrs.txt
```
# Options:
```
  -p, --pfile <file>       Payload File
  -t, --timeout <millis>   HTTP Timeout
  -u, --url <url>          Target URL
```
Currently only takes one URL as input but you can easily bash script for numerous URLs like so:
```
$ for i in $(cat urls); do headi -url $i;done
```
