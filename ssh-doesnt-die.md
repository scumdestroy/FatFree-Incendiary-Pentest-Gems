## CMD
autossh -M50000 -t server.example.com 'screen -raAd mysesh'

For example, if you were using irssi to lurk on IRC then you could do the following:

screen irssi (launches irssi in a screen session)
CTRL +A +D (minimizes the screen session and leaves it running in background)
screen -ls (lists all available screen sessions)
screen -r PID (re-opens a currently running screen session)
